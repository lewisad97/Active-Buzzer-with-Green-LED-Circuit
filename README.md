# Active-Buzzer-with-Green-LED-Circuit
A simple DC powered parallel circuit with Active Buzzer and Green LED.

Overview:
This project demonstrates a simple parallel circuit consisting of a current-limited LED and an active buzzer, powered from a 9V battery via a 5V breadboard power supply module.

A 9V battery is connected to the power supply module, which regulates the voltage to a stable 5V and distributes it to the power rails of an 830 tie-point breadboard. When the power module is switched on, both branches of the circuit are energised simultaneously.

One branch of the circuit contains a green LED in series with a current-limiting resistor. The resistor is used to restrict the current through the LED to a safe level, preventing damage. The forward voltage of the LED was measured at approximately 2.40V using a multimeter.

The second branch of the circuit supplies power to an active buzzer via jumper wires connected to the breadboard power rails. The buzzer emits an audible tone when the power supply module is switched on.

This circuit demonstrates the principles of parallel circuits, safe component protection, and regulated power distribution on a breadboard.
